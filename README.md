# SysON
SysON project provides an open-source web-based tooling to edit SysML v2 models. It includes a set of editors (graphical, textual, form-based, etc.) enabling users to build the various parts of system models.


## Flashcard :

Sirius is an open-source low-code platform to define custom web applications supporting your specific visual languages & dramatically reduces the time for creating domain-specific modeling workbenches which are integrated with SysML v2 Metamodel. Sirius Web uses PostgreSQL for its database.

The backend part of Sirius Components depends on sirius-emf-json, which is published as Maven artifacts in GitHub Packages. We need sirius-components locally, so we need GitHub Access Token so that Maven can download the sirius-emf-json artifacts.
